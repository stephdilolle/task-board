# Kanban Task Board

## Description

I added JavaScript functionality to a Kanban task board. \
This task board allows a user to keep track of items on their to-do list. They are able to add and delete tasks as well as move items between columns.


## Usage

This application allows the user to add a task to the to-do list. \
When 'add task' is clicked, the user is prompted to enter a title, description, and date the task is due. \
Once added, the user can then click and drag the task card to the 'in progress' or 'done' column. \
The application should also allow the user to click on the 'delete' button and see the task disappear from the list.
